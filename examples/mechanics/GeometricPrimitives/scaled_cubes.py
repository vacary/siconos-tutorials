# Here we demonstrate the use of two very small cubes simulated with
# geometry at 1000x its scale.  Without scaling, contact detection is
# incorrect for an object of this size.  When contact detection is
# performed with scaled-up geometries, the contact points are
# correctly generated and used by Siconos.
