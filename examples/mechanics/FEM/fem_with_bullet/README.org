* Try to understand how the contact detector of bullet is working with meshes


** Keep trace of the original meshes indices.

+ Do not know if it possible since stl file does not have the notion of vertices.

+ How the stl file in read in Siconos and give to bullet?


+ in BulletUtils  `display_info manifold`, we get the complete description of the btGImpactMeshShape contained in the collision shape.

  
** how to change the `shape_vs_shape_collision` algorithm such that we put our own contact points

+ Bullet puts maximum 4 point sper manifold and there is only one manifold by pair of collision shape.
  + is is really the case with convex shape?
  + this can be problematic with defomarble body when we want to more contact points when we have surface/surface contact.
